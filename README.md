# a-star-algorithm

This is a little project I'm working on to visualize [A* search algorithm.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)

All nodes are stored in memory, which sets a limit. 

## Development
Development is still ongoing. 
## Setup
```bash
 python3.11 -m  venv venv 
 source venv/bin/activate
 pip install -r requirements.txt # or:  `pip install pygame --pre`
```

## Inspiration
The idea came to my mind after watching this:
